## DAO Governance based on GitHub

### Gitvern your DAO:

- Built with :heart: &nbsp;by Developers for Developers
- Host your DAO dashboard on GitHub pages on your organization
- Run a Github App on any project leader's or organization's servers (GitHub and Dev Treasury keys are held here, so keep secure)
- Allow your token holders to approve and that way prioritize your GitHub issues by just making a MetaMask signature
- Use the same GitHub workflow that you are already familiar to assign issues to developers and attribute weights (labels)
- Dev Treasury smart-contract (on any EVM network) will hold the treasury funds and lock a slice for the issue assignee when work starts based on issue weight
- When an issue is closed successfully, the respective funds are unlocked and sent to the assignee wallet address in his profile
- At project launch, you can enable transfers for your token, setup a UniSwap Liquidity Pool and change approval to LP weight, to incentivize liquidity building
- DAO Governance made simple and effective
